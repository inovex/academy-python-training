# 1. Use scipy.stats.norm to generate a random sample of 100 variates from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
# 2. Use scipy.linalg to solve the following linear equation:
#       3x + 2y = 9
#        x - y = 1
# 3. Given the following sample data points, use scipy.interpolate to find the y value for x=3.5
#       - sample = [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5)]
# 4. Minimize the following function using scipy.optimize.minimize. Make an initial guess of x1=1 and x2=1. 
#    Print the minimum value and the return value of the function at the minimum.
#    f((x1, x2) = x1**2 + x[2]**2
