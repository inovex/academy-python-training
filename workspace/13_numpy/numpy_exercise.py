# 1. Create a 1-D NumPy array a of length = 4 containing random values between 0 and 100;
#    print it to the console
# 2. Create a 2-D NumPy array b containing the values [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
#       - print the second element of the third row
#       - print the last two elements of the first two rows
#       - append a column of zeros to the array
# 3. Perform some mathematical operations on the arrays and print the results:
#       - compute the product of b and a
#       - compute the median of b
#       - create a new array containing the remainders of b divided by 3
