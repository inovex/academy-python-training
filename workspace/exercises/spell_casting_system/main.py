# Create a file named main.py. Import the Magician class and create a list of the following magicians:
# Harry Potter, spells: lumos, accio
# Ron Weasley, spells: lumos
# Hermione Granger: lumos, accio, expelliarmus

# Using a control flow structure of your choice, iterate over the list of magicians and the following list of spells. If the magicians can cast the spell, have them cast it. Otherwise, have them learn the spell:
# spells = [‘expelliarmus’, ‘accio’, ‘lumos’, ‘petrificus totalus’, ‘wingardium leviosa’]

# Print the list of spells Hermione Granger knows.
# Print all spells Harry Potter knows that contain at least 4 vowels.
